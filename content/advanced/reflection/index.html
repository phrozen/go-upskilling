<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>The package reflect can be imported to work with reflections, it allow to know the type, the name and set values.
Since go is strongly typed reflection in go have 3 rules:</p>
<h4>Reflection goes from interface value to reflection object.</h4>
<p>The reflection package can get information from a interface such as type, name and value of a variable. This can be done with methods on the package, for example</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func TypeOf(i interface{}) Type
</code></pre>
<p>This functions receive a empty interface, since this can hold any value, so when a argument is passed in the function first is stored in a empty interface.</p>
<h4>Reflection goes from reflection object to interface value.</h4>
<p>Reflection goes both ways and it can be transform an interface to a value, this can be done with the following method</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (v Value) Interface() interface{}
</code></pre>
<h4>To modify a reflection object, the value must be settable.</h4>
<p>Settability is the ability to modify the original values of the object, this is related to the addressability of the object and that if we have a copy of the value or the value himself.</p>
<p>One can berify the settability of an object with the method <code>v.CanSet()</code></p>
<p>NOTE: All methods in reflection package assumes that the programmer knows that is doing and many functions and methods will panics when used incorrect.</p>
