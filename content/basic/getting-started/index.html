<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To download the go compiler just follow the following <a href="https://golang.org/doc/">instructions</a></p>
<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>The go compiler is expecting a structure for the imports, to do this it relays in the <code>$GOPATH</code> env variable, this variable will tell the go compiler were to found the modules to import.
The <code>$GOPATH</code> will contain a directory with 3 folders: <code>src</code>, <code>pkg</code> and <code>bin</code>.</p>
<h4>bin</h4>
<p>The bin directory contains the binary files installed by the command
<code>go install</code></p>
<h4>pkg</h4>
<p>The pkg directory contains the precompiled packages for future project compiles.</p>
<h4>src</h4>
<p>The src directory contains the source code of the projects. Since is usual to integrate github  in the projects, it is common that the structure of the src directory contains a github.com/user/project.</p>
