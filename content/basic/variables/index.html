<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>Golang support the following built-in types:</p>
<p>For strings:</p>
<ul>
<li>rune</li>
<li>string</li>
</ul>
<p>For Boolean values:</p>
<ul>
<li>bool</li>
</ul>
<p>For numeric types:</p>
<ul>
<li>int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64, int, uint, uintptr</li>
<li>byte (alias of uint8)</li>
<li>rune (alias of int32)</li>
<li>float32, float64.</li>
<li>complex64, complex128</li>
</ul>
<p>A variable can be declared in the following ways:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">var name string
var name1, name2 string = &quot;value&quot;, &quot;value2&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>A short way to declare a variable is using the <strong>:=</strong> operator, that is used to declare a variable with an implicit type based on the right side of the operation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">name := &quot;1&quot;
name1, name2, name3 := &quot;value&quot;, &quot;value2&quot;, &quot;value3&quot;
i := 1
i,j,k := 0, 1, 2

</code></pre>
<h3>Strings and Runes</h3>
<p>Strings by default are <em><strong>UTF8</strong></em>, with this using a char is not possible, since the size of a char is 1 byte, and a UTF8 symbol can use up to 4 bytes (32 bits), to solve this problem runes are used to avoid having problems with unicode sets.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;
)

func printByChar(s string) {
    chars := []byte(s)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;This slice has a len of %d\n&quot;, len(chars))

    for i, c := range chars {
        fmt.Printf(&quot;Char %d value is %d\n&quot;, i, c)
    }
}

func printByRune(s string) {
    runes := []rune(s)
    fmt.Printf(&quot;This slice has a len of %d\n&quot;, len(runes))
    for i, r := range runes {
    fmt.Printf(&quot;Rune %d value is %c\n&quot;, i, r)
    }
}

func main() {
    hello := &quot;Hello world ðŸ‘‹ðŸŒŽ&quot;
    hello2 := &quot;Hello workd!!!&quot;
    fmt.Printf(&quot;String 1 has a len of %d\n&quot;, len(hello))
    fmt.Printf(&quot;String 2 has a len of %d\n&quot;, len(hello2))

    printByChar(hello)
    printByChar(hello2)
    printByRune(hello)
    printByRune(hello2)

}
</code></pre>

<p>In this example we can see that the two string has the same number of characters both have different length, since one has unicode characters, but when a rune is used to read it, both have the same size.</p>
<h3>Alias</h3>
<p>Alias are a way of renaming a type of variable, for example:
A byte and rune are alias and int32 respective, this mean that they are not different types of data but they have an alternative spelling.</p>
<p>This is something similar of int and char in C, you can do operation with them since they have the same size, but is not the same since Go will not let you operation between then because they have the size, but since they are the same type but with different name.</p>
<h3>Constants</h3>
<p>Constants works like another language and have to follow this rules
They have to use they keyword cons  to be declared
Can only be can be <em><strong>character, string, boolean, or numeric values</strong></em>.
Cannot be declared with the := shortcut</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">const name = &quot;value&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Zero values</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>0</strong> for numeric types</li>
<li><strong>false</strong> for the boolean</li>
<li><strong>&quot;&quot;</strong> (empty string) for strings</li>
<li><strong>nil</strong> for pointer types</li>
</ul>
